Data visualisation using data from Ireland's Property Price Register
=======================

## About

A quick hack using data from Ireland's [Property Price Register](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en) to play around with [D3](http://d3js.org), [dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/) and [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) data visualisation. The dataset in use here is not dynamically retrieved from the PPR website, it is taken from a static grab of house sale data from the PPR. The primary motivation here is to play around with data visualisation rather than to provide yet another PPR search tool.
